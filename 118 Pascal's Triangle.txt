Intuition
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above.

Approach
Algorithm
Step 1 : We create List of list which will store the rows. This is important because to get the series of pascal's triangle, the series depends on "the previous rows two numbers".
Step 2 : Get 'n' as number of rows. Till which row we need to generate the series.
Step 3 : We run a loop from 1 to n using interator 'i'.
Step 4 :
If the i is 1 then it very first row of triangle, so we directly add first row with '1'
In every iteration we use previous generated rows, which is stored in List of list. (List list = parent.get(i-2))
Now we run (using 'j' as iterator) a loop which will generate a row and run till row's length(i.e 'i')
Now that we have previous generated row, we simply add two numbers from previous list and add it the new list.
Remember, Pascal's Triangle first and last digit is always one. So if 'j' value is 1 or equal to 'i' we simply add 1 to list.
To get two elements from previous list, we maintain a 'prev' pointer and 'current'(orev+1) pointer. Sum of elements on these indexes will be added to list. And 'prev' will incremented by one.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n*m) to create rows and columns.
Space complexity:
O(n*m) to create rows and columns.


Code
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> generate(int numRows) 
    {
        int n = numRows;
        List<List<Integer>> parent = new LinkedList<>();
        
        for(int i=1 ; i<=n; i++)
        {
            int prev=0;
            List<Integer> child = new LinkedList<Integer>();
            if(i==1)
            {
                child.add(1);
                parent.add(child);
                continue;
            }

            List<Integer> list = parent.get(i-2);

            for(int j=1; j<=i; j++)
            {
                if(j==1 || j==i)
                {
                    child.add(1);
                }
                else
                {
                    
                    int current = prev+1;
                    int sum = list.get(prev) + list.get(current);
                    child.add(sum);
                    prev++;
                   
                }
            }

            parent.add(child);
        }
        return parent;  
    }
}
