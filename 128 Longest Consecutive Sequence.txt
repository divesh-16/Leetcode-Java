Intuition
The first thing which comes to mind when I here 'consecutive' is sorted elements. And the data structure which stores element in sorted order is TreeSet in Java.
So, we will store the element in the TreeSet and find the length of consecutive elements presented in array.


Approach
Step 1 : Create TreeSet object.
Step 2 : Store all element of array in the TreeSet.
Step 3 : Once all elements are stored, initialize 'length' to 0 and 'max' to which wil maintain current length and maximum length.
Step 4 : Iterate through the TreeSet
First maintain 'prev' ; which will store previous consecutive element if found any.
while iterating through TreeSet,
we will check if prev element is just 1 less than current element. If yes increment length by 1.
Else, we check whether the current length is greater than maximum(max). If yes we assign max to length. (max = length) and length to 1.
Else we just assign length = 1.
Step 5 : Check if current length is greater than maximum, if yes then return current length.
Step 6 : We found our maximum, just return 'max' variable.


Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n) to traverse array.
O(n) to traverse TreeSet
Therefore O(2n) ~ O(n)
Space complexity:
O(n) as we creating TreeSet with n elements


Code
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) 
    {
       if(nums.length ==0)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        int n=nums.length;
        TreeSet<Integer> ts = new TreeSet<>();
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            ts.add(nums[i]);
        }

        int length = 1;
        int max = 1;

        Iterator it = ts.iterator();
        int prev =(int) it.next();
       // System.out.print(" "+prev);
        while(it.hasNext())
        {
            int element = (int)it.next();
            if(prev+1 == element)
            {
                length++;
            }
            else if(length > max)
            {
                max = length;
                length=1;
            }
            else
            {
                length = 1;
            }
            

            prev = element;
            //System.out.print(" "+element);
            
        }
   
        if(length > max)
        {
            max = length;
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
