Intuition
Store the newly created nodes in hash table/map with its original copy

Approach
Step 1 : Create a hash map / table which stores current node and newly created node based on current node.
Step 2 : Create nodes while traversing the list and assign node's next and random to null.
Step 3 : After creating the node, store the current node and newly created node in the map/table.
Step 4 : Now, start from head again. Get the mapped node (Y) with get current node. Assign node's next (Y.next ) to current node's next in map. In same way, assign node's random to current node's random in map. Like this the whole list will be made with random pointers.
return map's node mapped to head pointer.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n) to traverse the list.
Space complexity:
O(n) store nodes in the hash map/table.

Code
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    int val;
    Node next;
    Node random;

    public Node(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
        this.random = null;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) 
    {
        Map<Node,Node> map = new HashMap<>();

        Node T = head;

        while(T!=null)
        {
            Node Y = new Node(T.val);
            Y.next = null;
            Y.random = null;
            map.put(T,Y);

            T = T.next;
        }

        T = head;

        while(T != null)
        {
            Node Y = map.get(T);
            Y.next = map.get(T.next);
            Y.random = map.get(T.random);

            T = T.next;
        }

        return map.get(head);
    }
}
