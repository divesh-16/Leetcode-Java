Intuition
We Sort the array.
Then we return the num[nums.length/2] element.

Approach
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times
If we try to understand this line at its core, it simply tells that the element appears on more than half indexes of an array.
And to do that it(element) must appear at least on [n/2]+1(half+1) indexes. eg : n = 3, the element must appear more than 1 time.
Therefore we return nums[n/2];
Sorting the is essential before returning and finding the half of the array. Sorting aligns similar elements consecutively in array.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O nlogn to sort the array.
Space complexity:
O(1)


Code
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) 
    {
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        return nums[nums.length/2];
    }
}
