Intuition
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

So Basically we need to count of each character in the first String, then minus the count of each similar character . If count of all character becomes zero then it is anagram.

Approach
We create int array of 26 size, as there are 26 letters in english.
Where index 0 counts for character 'a', index 1 for 'b' and likewise.
Now we traverse the 1st String, and count occurrence of each letter.
Once we have traversed the 1st String, now we travel the 2nd String.
Here, instead of counting the letters, we will decrease the count of a letter by 1 whenever we encounter the similar letter.
If it is an anagram then the array will contain only zeros and we return true. If array contains any number greater than zero value then it is not a anagram.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n) to traverse the first String
O(n) to traverse the second String
O(2n) ~ O(n)
Space complexity:
O(1) constant space, as we require only array of 26 size everytime.


Code
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) 
    {
    

        int chars[] = new int[26];
        
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++)
        {
            int ch = ((int)s.charAt(i) ) -97;

            chars[ch]+=1;

        }

       // System.out.println(Arrays.toString(chars));

        for(int i=0; i<t.length(); i++)
        {
            int ch = ((int)t.charAt(i)) -97;

            chars[ch]-=1;
            
        }

       // System.out.println(Arrays.toString(chars));
        int i=0;

        for( ;i<chars.length; i++)
        {
            if(chars[i] !=0)
                return false;
        }


        return true;    
    }
}
