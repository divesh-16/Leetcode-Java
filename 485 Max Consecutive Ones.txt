Intuition
We will traverse the array and maintain two counters.
'prev' to store max count of consecutive 1's
'cnt' which will count 1's consecutively and assign itself to 0 if zero is found.

Approach
If element nums[i] is 1 we increment cnt by 1 (cnt++)

If it is not 1 then it will be 0, then we assign cnt to 0 (cnt = 0)

At last we check if the current count(cnt) is greater than previous count(prev), if yes then we put greater value in prev counter (prev = cnt).

At last we return 'prev' as it stores max length of consecutive 1's.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n) to traverse the whole array.
Space complexity:
O(1) - requires constant space each time.


Code
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) 
    {
        int prev=0;
        int cnt=0;

        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++)
        {
            if(nums[i] == 1)
            {
                cnt++;
                if(cnt>prev)
                {
                    prev = cnt;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                cnt=0;
            }     
            
        }


        return prev;
    }
}
